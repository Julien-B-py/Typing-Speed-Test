**Typing Speed Test** is a desktop application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where you can test your keyboard typing skills.

To find out how fast are your fingers:

- Run main.py.

- Start typing the highlighted word to run the 60 seconds timer.

- Press the space bar after each word. 

- At the end, you'll get your typing speed and accuracy.
